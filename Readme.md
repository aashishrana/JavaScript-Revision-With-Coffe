This is the readme file

prefer not to use var due to block scope and functional scope
Whenever object form by constructor always singelton object

// Singleton object always created with new keyword

// this refers to the current context 
// this used only inside object not in function

Immediatly invoked function mostly used to connect database atomaatically

Global execution context
to run anyline of code gec is necessary this keyword is necessary in memory phase assign the value is undefined

parallely in execution phase assign the values to the variables

after that same process going on the function

and then use call stack

In JavaScript event runs sequentially some exceptions
in event bubbling propagation start from inside to outside
to stop propagation e.stopPropagation()

API is just a talking language between 2- systems backend kisi aur ko frontend kisi aur ka 
backend kisi aur language me frontend kisi aur language me


we will recape promises video once again after some time specially fetch request


## constructor function always makes copy not effect original values
